#### Permissions

![](/assets/img/jingles/users04.png)

FiFo includes a very powerful fine grained permission system that lets you tailor specific permissions for specific users or groups. This allows you to control what areas within the "User Interface" users can see and what actions they may perform on different objects such as machines, datasets, packages etc.

It is beyond the scope of this section to explain the permission system in necessary depth. For further information please consult the permissions wiki article.

#### Groups

The groups section allows you to add users to certain pre-existing groups. Users who get assigned to a specific group will inherit all the permissions and access rights of that group.

#### SSH Keys

You can add your own ssh public key to your user profile by simply pasting in your key and clicking the save button. This will be used when the user creates a new machine and FiFo will automatically add the users key to the machines authorized_keys file. You should then be able to authenticate your ssh session without requiring password entry.
